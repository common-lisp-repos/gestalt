Note: note that both the formula as a dependent, and the formula arguments are bound weakly...is that correct? Yes..formulas are supposed to bind arguments; if no arguments are to be bound, then use a function. Functions are used when, for example, we want to display a message independently of the changing object. Example:

(add-dependent some-cell 'changed (lambda (event)
				    (declare (ignore event))
				    (print "hola")))

In this case, we cannot bind the lambda function weakly, because it would get lost. Formulas are different, because they simply calculate a value, and are not supposed to produce a side effect. So, we want them to get lost if we do not bind them from somewhere else than the changing cell.
